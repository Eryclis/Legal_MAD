Res ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of an accident, but it only applies when the accident would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence. In this case, the accident of the tuna being unfit for consumption is not the type of accident that would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence on the part of Canco. The intervening act of the plumbing contractor's workmen, which was not caused by Canco, is a superseding cause that breaks the chain of causation between Canco's packing of the tuna and the injury suffered by Dotty and Guest. Therefore, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable in this case.",

          "argument": "The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is applicable in this case because the tuna was packed in a sealed can. Res ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that infers negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury, where it appears more probable that the accident was caused by negligence than by other causes. In this case, the sealed can of tuna was knocked over and damaged, and the contents were consumed by Dotty and Guest, resulting in illness. The sealed can is a crucial factor in this case because it suggests that the damage to the tuna occurred after it was packed by Canco. If the can had been damaged during the packing process, it is likely that the damage would have been visible. The fact that the can was sealed and the damage occurred after it was packed by Canco raises a presumption of negligence on the part of Canco. This is consistent with the reasoning in the case of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 328D, which states that 'the fact that an accident or resulting harm was such as ordinarily would not occur in the absence of negligence may give rise to an inference of negligence.'",

It is equally possible that the can was damaged during the packing process, but the damage was not visible until after the can was sealed.
